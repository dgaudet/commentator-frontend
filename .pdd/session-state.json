      "task": "Quick technical design for class dropdown refactor\n\n## Context\nI've completed the product requirements for a class dropdown selector feature (L1-MICRO complexity, ~1 week, 8 story points total).\n\n## Feature Overview\nTransform the existing ClassList component from a vertical list display into a dropdown selector where:\n1. User selects a class from dropdown (format: 'name - year')\n2. Selected class's ClassListItem displays below the dropdown\n3. Dropdown remains visible for easy class switching\n4. Selection persists in localStorage across sessions\n\n## User Stories (2 total - 8 story points)\n- **US-DROPDOWN-001**: Select Class from Dropdown (5 pts, HIGH)\n- **US-DROPDOWN-002**: Persist Selected Class (3 pts, MEDIUM)\n\n## Key Requirements\n- Refactor existing ClassList component (src/components/classes/ClassList.tsx)\n- Reuse ClassListItem component for selected class display\n- Use native HTML <select> for accessibility (MVP - no custom dropdown)\n- Integrate with existing useClasses hook\n- Maintain all existing functionality (Add, Edit, Delete, View Outcome Comments)\n- Persist selection in localStorage (key: commentator.selectedClassId)\n- Handle edge cases: deleted classes, empty list, API errors\n\n## Technical Constraints\n- Must maintain 90%+ test coverage\n- Must pass WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit\n- No API changes required (uses existing GET /class)\n- Must work with existing Class type and useClasses hook\n\n## Existing Architecture\n- ClassList currently renders array of ClassListItem components\n- useClasses hook provides: classes[], isLoading, error, clearError, deleteClass\n- ClassListItem accepts: classItem, onView, onEdit, onDelete, onViewOutcomeComments\n\n## What I Need From You\n1. **Component Architecture**: How to refactor ClassList (new components? state structure?)\n2. **State Management**: Local state vs. custom hook? How to handle persistence?\n3. **localStorage Utilities**: Pattern for get/set/validate stored class ID\n4. **TDD Task Breakdown**: Atomic tasks with Red-Green-Refactor sequence\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues with component refactoring\n\n## Reference Artifacts\n- Complete PRD: pdd-workspace/class-dropdown/planning/minimal-prd.md\n- Existing ClassList: src/components/classes/ClassList.tsx\n- Existing ClassListItem: src/components/classes/ClassListItem.tsx (user is currently viewing this file)\n- Class type: src/types/Class.ts\n\n## Request\nPlease create a quick technical design following the specification-first TDD methodology. The design should be production-ready and enable the frontend developer to implement with confidence.\n\n**Architecture Review Status**: SKIPPED (L1-MICRO - this is a quick design review, not a formal architecture gate)",
