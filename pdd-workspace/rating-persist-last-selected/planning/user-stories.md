# User Stories: Rating Selector Persistence
## Feature: Preserve Last Selected Rating in PersonalizedCommentsModal

### Overview
As a teacher creating or editing student comments with ratings, I want the rating selector to remember my last selection so that I don't have to re-select the same rating when adding multiple comments with similar sentiments.

**Business Value**: Improves user experience and workflow efficiency when bulk-adding or editing multiple personalized comments with similar ratings.

## Notes & Clarifications

### Scope of "Last Selected"
- **In-modal session**: The rating persists while the modal is open
- **Cross-modal**: When reopening the modal, resets to 3 (prevents accidental mis-ratings on different subjects)
- **Edit to Add**: When returning from edit mode, the edited comment's rating becomes the persistent rating for add mode

### Design Considerations
- No new UI elements required; behavior change only
- Leverages existing EmojiRatingSelector component
- Minimal state management changes in PersonalizedCommentsModal

### Related Features
- **US-RATING-001**: Original rating selector specification
- **US-RATING-003**: Add Rating Selector to Forms
- **US-RATING-004**: Display Rating in Comments List + Sort by Rating

### User Research Insight
*From toDos.md notes*: "The rating should stay on the last one picked instead of the middle" - indicates user feedback that middle (3/neutral) default is not intuitive for workflow efficiency.
