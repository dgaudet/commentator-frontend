  "title": "Add Tab Group for Class Editing and Final Comments",
  "description": "Add a nested tab group within the Class Management interface that displays when a class is selected. The tab group contains two tabs: 'Edit Class' (with edit/delete functionality) and 'Final Comments' (showing the final comments view for the selected class). This improves navigation and organizes class-related functionality more clearly.",

    "reasoning": "Reuses existing Tabs/TabPanel components from SubjectListItem pattern. Reorganizes existing UI elements (edit form, final comments button) into tabbed interface. No new backend APIs required. Estimated 1-2 weeks with 5 user stories covering tab group display, tab switching, content integration, and styling consistency.",
