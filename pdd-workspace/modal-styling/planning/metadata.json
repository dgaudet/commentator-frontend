    "level": "L0-ATOMIC",
    "reasoning": "Pure styling changes to match existing design system with removal of unnecessary UI elements. Similar to completed tab-bar-styling feature. Changes are localized to 3 component files with minimal risk. No new functionality, API changes, or architectural modifications required. Estimated effort < 1 day.",
