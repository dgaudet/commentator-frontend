# To Do Items
## need to rename the current class to subject
### ask it about the known technical debt, and ask it to work on it
1. OutcomeCommentsModal: Still expects Class type with year field (temporary workaround in place)
2. E2E Tests: Still reference Class components (Sprint 3 task)
3. Documentation: README and inline docs still reference Class terminology (Sprint 3 task)
## Need a the code for classes

## Need a page to add/edit PersonalizedComments for a class
- this page should also show the final comments for the class
## Need a page to add/edit finalComments for a class
# Personalized Comments
## show a count of which comment you are on ex: 1 out of 100
## how should we order them?
The act function seems to be deprecated but it's used in tests and code
## When you create a subject, it should be selected automatically even if it's not the only subject created
If you have an subject selected, and you open the outcome comments, then switch the subject, the outcome comments modal should update to show the comments for the newly selected subject
* Or perhaps just have it close the outcome comments when you switch
