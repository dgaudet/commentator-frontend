# To Do Items
## Need a page to add/edit FinalComments for a class
# Personalized Comments
## show a count of which comment you are on ex: 1 out of 100
## how should we order them?
# The act function seems to be deprecated but it's used in tests and code
## When you create a subject, it should be selected automatically even if it's not the only subject created
If you have an subject selected, and you open the outcome comments, then switch the subject, the outcome comments modal should update to show the comments for the newly selected subject
* Or perhaps just have it close the outcome comments when you switch
